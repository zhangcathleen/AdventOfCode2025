# AdventOfCode2025

This is my solution to the advent of code challenge https://adventofcode.com/

## Day 1

- Learned python has an object type called deques - like a list that can rotate
- Remembered what modulo was and learned python has divmod, which returns the quotient and remainder of 2 values
- Had to figure out the code order of increasing the number of times the dial passes 0 and where to set the dial value as the safe[0] value
- Took 2 days Dec 9 - 10 ( bc got bored and was sick)
