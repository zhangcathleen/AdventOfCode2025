# AdventOfCode2025

This is my solution to the advent of code challenge https://adventofcode.com/

## Day 2
Part 1 : 
- Remembered how tuples work. Learned how to add tuples 
- There's probably a more efficient way to go through the loop than changing from string -> list -> tuples of integers -> string -> list -> integer
- Also learned python has sum()

In part 2 :
- Learned there's math.ceil - rounds numbers up. Didn't end up using it
- It might be most efficient to find the factors for the number of digits in the id

## Day 1

- Learned python has an object type called deques - like a list that can rotate
- Remembered what modulo was and learned python has divmod, which returns the quotient and remainder of 2 values
- Had to figure out the code order of increasing the number of times the dial passes 0 and where to set the dial value as the safe[0] value
- Took 2 days Dec 9 - 10 ( bc got bored and was sick)
